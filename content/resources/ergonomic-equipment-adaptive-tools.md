# My Personal Ergonomic Equipment Recommendations for Disability and Chronic Pain

A lot of people ask me for advice about ergonomic equipment and the equipment that I use for my person chronic disability. I usually then ask people if there's anything specific that they're interested in, whether it be a desk, a keyboard, or anything else. The response I get every time is, "Everything!" So, instead of typing up my recommendations from scratch each time, I am consolidating my personal experiences and recommendations into this guide. Of course, you should always consult with your doctor and an ergonomist instead of just relying on one random person's experiences, but I hope some of these recommendations can get people started.

## Standing Desk

### Overview
A standing desk is one of the most important investments you can make. It allows for positional variety between sitting and standing, provides better flexibility in achieving proper ergonomic height, and opens up your body more than sitting alone.

### Considerations
- Measure your ideal desk height in a proper ergonomic position.
- Ensure the minimum and maximum heights fit your body.

### Personal Recommendations
- [Varidesk](https://www.vari.com/desks-and-tables/standing-desks/): I personally use a Varidesk, but there are many solid standing desks out there now. 
- [Vari Desktop Converter](https://www.vari.com/varidesk-converters/for-small-spaces/): A cheaper option is a table-top converter.

## Ergonomic Chair

### Overview
A good ergonomic chair is critical for long-term health and comfort. It is something you may not fully appreciate until you upgrade from a standard chair.

### Considerations
Many people overlook the importance of comfort over aesthetics. While the most ergonomically friendly chairs might not fit a stylish office setup, investing in them is key for long-term support. There is also a wide price range, with high-end chairs costing well over a thousand dollars. Most sources online recommend against a gaming chair, but in my personal experience, I've found them to be a good value for the money compared to comparably priced office chairs.

## Vertical Mouse

### Overview
A vertical mouse helps maintain a more natural wrist position by encouraging movement from the shoulder rather than the wrist.

### Considerations
Focus on selecting a design that supports a natural wrist position and minimizes strain.

### Recommendations
- [Logitech MX Vertical](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Vertical-Wireless-Mouse-Rechargeable/dp/B07FNJB8TT): Highly recommended for its ergonomic design.
- [RollerMouse](https://contourdesign.com/collections/rollermouse): Suitable for ambidextrous use, though pricier.

## Ergonomic Keyboard

### Overview
An ergonomic keyboard is one of the most important investments you can make to reduce strain and improve typing comfort.

### Considerations
Key factors include portability, connectivity, and the type of key feel you prefer (mechanical or non-mechanical).

### Recommendations
- [Kinesis Freestyle2 Blue](https://kinesis-ergo.com/shop/freestyle2-blue-mac/): Lightweight, portable, and Bluetooth-enabled. This keyboard is my most common recommendation for people who want to buy their first ergonomic keyboard.
- [Kinesis Freestyle Pro](https://kinesis-ergo.com/shop/freestyle-pro/): A mechanical option with one of the best pure "typing" experiences out there.
- [Freestyle2 + Ascent Tenting](https://kinesis-ergo.com/shop/freestyle2-mac/): Premium option with the Ascent accessory for typing at up to an 80-degree angle. ([Ascent accessory](https://kinesis-ergo.com/shop/freestyle2-ascent-accessory/))

## Wrist Support

### Overview
Traditional padded wrist rests may cause more harm than good by encouraging you to push down into them.

### Considerations
Excessive pressure on the wrists from padded supports can worsen your posture or cause strain.

### Recommendations
- [Carpio from Deltahub](https://deltahub.io/): I personally use this wrist rest as it lets your wrist "glide," helping you to move your whole arm and not just your wirst.

## Conclusion

Having to invest in all this equipment for your personal health is not fun, and it can add up in cost. However, the additional benefit that these tools provide in my ability to work longer and potentially save money on future medical bills makes it well worth it to me.
